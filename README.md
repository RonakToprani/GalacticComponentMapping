# GalacticComponentMapping
This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to map galactic components in the M74 galaxy using astronomical FITS image data. The code presented here demonstrates the entire pipeline, including data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction, training a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, and evaluating the model's performance
